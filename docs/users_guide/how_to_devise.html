    <h2>6. How to devise effective test cases</h2>

        <p>Just running BidiChecker on random pages of your application
      may reveal some bidi support errors, but it is unlikely to be an
      effective approach to bidi testing. To start with the obvious, if
      you run bidi checks on a page with a left-to-right UI and contents
      in a left-to-right language, you probably won't find any errors,
      but neither would you have tested the handling of right-to-left
      text! An application with an LTR UI should at the minimum run
      BidiChecker on each page while displaying RTL text contents. For
      example, a search application should test pages with an RTL search
      query. If your application also supports RTL UIs, they should be
      tested both with RTL contents and with LTR contents, as each one
      may reveal different errors.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that most user input fields, and output which displays
      them, should be able to support RTL contents, even on an LTR
      page. Hebrew- and Arabic-speaking users may access web content or
      enter data in their native languages, even if the UI is in
      English. There are exceptions; fields such as phone numbers, currency
      values or e-mail addresses need only support LTR data (though the
      human name associated with an e-mail account may well be RTL). But as
      a rule, any data field your application displays may need to handle
      RTL text. Thorough testing should include displaying RTL contents in
      every such field and checking the page with BidiChecker.</p>
